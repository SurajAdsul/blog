In today's fast-paced development environment, efficiently managing and interacting with Salesforce data is crucial. I'm excited to introduce **Salesforce MCP Server**, a powerful tool that bridges the gap between natural language processing and Salesforce development. This package enables developers to interact with Salesforce using natural language through Claude AI integration.

## Getting Started
Install the package and check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/surajadsul/mcp-server-salesforce) for detailed documentation and examples.

This is originally developed by [tsmztech](https://github.com/tsmztech). I have just added support for Oauth and support for Cursor IDE with refined documentation.

## What is Salesforce MCP Server?

Salesforce MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation that revolutionizes how developers interact with Salesforce. It allows you to query, modify, and manage your Salesforce objects and records using everyday language rather than complex SOQL queries or API calls.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Object Management
- Create and modify custom objects using natural language
- Intuitive field management and relationship creation
- Automatic handling of complex metadata operations

### 2. Intelligent Search Capabilities
- Find objects using partial name matches
- Search across multiple objects simultaneously
- SOSL integration for comprehensive search functionality

### 3. Advanced Data Operations
- Complex queries with relationship support
- Flexible data manipulation (insert, update, delete, upsert)
- Cross-object search capabilities

### 4. Developer-Friendly Integration
- Seamless integration with Cursor IDE and Claude Desktop
- Multiple authentication methods support
- Comprehensive error handling and feedback

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
npm install -g @surajadsul02/mcp-server-salesforce
```

### Authentication Options

The package supports two authentication methods:

1. **Username/Password Authentication**
   - Traditional username/password with security token
   - Perfect for development and testing environments

2. **OAuth2 Authentication**
   - Secure consumer key/secret authentication
   - Ideal for production environments and enterprise applications

&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Cursor IDE Setup
Configure the MCP server in Cursor IDE `.cursor/mcp.json`:
Check MCP servers in Cursor settings whether it's acive or not.
Then in Cursor composer ask it describe the `Account` object.

Try restarting Cursor if it does not work initially.


```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce": {
      "command": "env",
      "args": [
        "SALESFORCE_USERNAME=your.email@example.com",
        "SALESFORCE_PASSWORD=YourPassword",
        "SALESFORCE_TOKEN=YourToken",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "@surajadsul02/mcp-server-salesforce"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Real-World Examples

Let's look at some practical examples of how you can interact with Salesforce using natural language:

&nbsp;
### 1. Object Discovery
`
"Find all objects related to customer service"
`

This simple command will search through your org and find all objects related to customer service, including standard and custom objects.

&nbsp;
### 2. Schema Analysis
`
"What fields are available in the Account object?"
`

Get a comprehensive list of fields, their types, and relationships for any object.

&nbsp;
### 3. Complex Queries
`
"Show me high-priority Cases with their related Contacts created this month"
`

Execute complex SOQL queries without writing a single line of code.

&nbsp;
### 4. Data Manipulation
`
"Create a Customer Feedback object with Rating and Comments fields"
`

Perform metadata operations using simple English instructions.
