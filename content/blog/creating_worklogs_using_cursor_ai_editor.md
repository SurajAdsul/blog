Keeping a structured and detailed worklog is essential for tracking progress, maintaining accountability, and improving productivity. The Cursor AI editor provides an efficient way to maintain daily worklogs with a predefined structure. This guide outlines the best practices for creating and managing worklogs using Cursor AI.

## Worklog Format and Structure
Each daily worklog should follow a consistent structure for clarity and ease of reference. The format should be as follows:

```markdown
# Daily Worklog - [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Summary
- Brief overview of the day's main accomplishments
- Key decisions made
- Any blockers encountered

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Task 1
  - Details/Implementation notes
- [x] Task 2
  - Details/Implementation notes

## In Progress
- [ ] Ongoing task 1
  - Current status
  - Next steps

## Blockers/Issues
- List any blockers or issues encountered
- Include potential solutions or workarounds

## Notes
- Additional important information
- Links to relevant resources
- Meeting notes or decisions

## Tomorrow's Plan
- [ ] Planned task 1
- [ ] Planned task 2

## Time Tracking
- Task 1: X hours
- Task 2: Y hours


## Worklog Guidelines
To maintain consistency and organization, adhere to these guidelines:

1. **Date Format**: Always use `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2024-03-21`).
2. **Storage Location**: Store worklogs in the directory structure `docs/worklogs/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
3. **Naming Convention**: Use lowercase filenames and adhere to the `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format.
4. **Task Status**: Use `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks.
5. **Time Tracking**: Always include time spent on major tasks for better time management.
6. **Links**: Include relevant links such as PRs, documentation, or meeting notes.
7. **Blockers**: Clearly document any blockers, their status, and any attempted solutions.

## Best Practices
To ensure your worklogs remain useful and effective, follow these best practices:

1. **Start at the Beginning of the Day**: Outline planned tasks and priorities.
2. **Update Throughout the Day**: Keep track of completed tasks and new developments.
3. **Finalize at the End of the Day**: Review and ensure completeness before storing.
4. **Include Technical Details**: Be specific about implementations, changes, and issues faced.
5. **Reference Relevant Tickets/Issues**: Include issue numbers and descriptions where applicable.
6. **Maintain Professionalism**: Use clear and professional language.
7. **Document Decisions and Rationale**: Ensure clarity on why certain decisions were made.
